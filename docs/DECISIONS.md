## ADR-018: Embedded Web UI via Go embed

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-02-28
- Context: users need a visual client to interact with the Agent Hub without writing curl commands or building a separate frontend project.
- Decision:
  - add a Vite + TypeScript (no framework) frontend under `web/src/`.
  - build output lands in `web/dist/`, embedded via `//go:embed web/dist` in `internal/webui/webui.go`.
  - register `GET /` and `GET /assets/*` in `httpapi` (lower priority than all `/v1/*` and `/healthz` routes).
  - SPA fallback: any non-API path returns `index.html`.
  - `make build-web` produces the dist; `web/dist` is committed so users without Node.js can still `go build`.
  - startup output includes a QR code for quickly opening the UI from another device on the same LAN.
- Consequences: single-binary distribution with no external file dependencies; Go binary size increases by the size of the minified JS/CSS bundle (~200–400 KB estimated). Build pipeline requires Node.js for frontend changes.
- Alternatives considered: separate static file directory (requires deployment of two artifacts); WebSocket-only SPA (rejected: SSE already implemented); React/Vue framework (rejected: adds runtime bundle weight and build complexity).
- Follow-up actions: add `npm run build` to CI pipeline; version-pin Node.js in project tooling docs.

## ADR-025: Hard-delete Thread Endpoint with Active-turn Lock

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-03-03
- Context: users need to clean historical threads from both API and Web UI, while preserving the one-active-turn-per-thread guarantee and avoiding partial deletes.
- Decision:
  - add `DELETE /v1/threads/{threadId}` with ownership enforcement based on `X-Client-ID`.
  - return `409 CONFLICT` when the target thread currently has an active turn.
  - reserve a temporary turn-controller slot during deletion so no new turn can start on that thread while delete is in progress.
  - perform storage deletion in one transaction with explicit dependency order: `events` -> `turns` -> `threads`.
  - close and evict cached per-thread agent provider after successful delete.
- Consequences: deletion is deterministic and race-safe with active turn startup, but remains irreversible (no soft-delete/recover endpoint).
- Alternatives considered: soft-delete tombstone model, relying only on foreign-key cascades, and best-effort delete without turn-controller lock.
- Follow-up actions: add optional audit trail for delete operations if compliance requirements increase.

## ADR-028: Persist Thread Config Overrides and Surface Reasoning Control in Web UI

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-03-06
- Context:
  - thread-scoped `config-options` support already enabled immediate model switching, but non-model settings like reasoning only lived inside the current ACP session.
  - for stdio providers (`opencode`, `qwen`, `gemini`), a reasoning change would otherwise disappear on the next turn because each turn starts a fresh ACP process.
  - Web UI only surfaced model in the composer footer, even though ACP can report model-specific reasoning choices in the same `configOptions` payload.
- Decision:
  - persist non-model current values returned by `POST /v1/threads/{threadId}/config-options` into `agentOptions.configOverrides`.
  - keep `agentOptions.modelId` as the durable model mirror, and store other current config values by config id in `configOverrides`.
  - update all built-in providers to reapply persisted non-model overrides on new ACP sessions:
    - embedded (`codex`, `claude`) reapply overrides after `session/new` on cached runtime initialization.
    - stdio (`opencode`, `qwen`, `gemini`, `kimi`) reapply overrides after `session/new` before `session/prompt`.
  - extend the Web UI composer footer to show both `Model` and `Reasoning` controls sourced from thread `configOptions`, with reasoning options refreshed after model changes.
  - cache config catalogs in the Web UI by agent id so same-agent threads reuse one shared model/reasoning option list without re-querying on every thread switch.
- Consequences:
  - reasoning-style settings now survive across future turns and restart/provider reinitialization boundaries.
  - reasoning remains model-specific because the UI always redraws from the latest ACP-reported thread config options after model changes.
  - switching between threads on the same agent is cheaper because the UI reuses the cached agent catalog and only applies thread-specific current values locally.
  - other non-model config categories are persisted server-side but are not yet surfaced as first-class UI controls beyond reasoning.
- Alternatives considered:
  - UI-only reasoning selector without persistence.
  - provider-specific persistence logic for reasoning rather than generic thread config override storage.
- Follow-up actions:
  - evaluate surfacing additional ACP config categories in the UI when product requirements justify more advanced controls.

## ADR-026: Thread-level Model Override Update API and Provider Reset

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-03-05
- Context: users need to choose model at thread creation time and switch model on existing threads from Web UI/API without breaking one-active-turn-per-thread guarantees.
- Decision:
  - standardize thread-level model override as `agentOptions.modelId`.
  - add `PATCH /v1/threads/{threadId}` to update `agentOptions` for owned threads.
  - reject updates with `409 CONFLICT` while the thread has an active turn.
  - close cached per-thread provider after successful update so next turn re-initializes provider/session with new model config.
  - wire `modelId` into all provider factories; embedded `codex`/`claude` pass it to ACP `session/new` as `model`; `gemini` passes it to `session/new` and `session/prompt`; `opencode` passes `modelId` in `session/prompt`; `qwen` passes `model` in `session/prompt`.
- Consequences: model switching becomes explicit and deterministic at thread boundary; switching takes effect on next turn (not mid-turn) and may incur one provider re-init.
- Alternatives considered: in-session mutable model switching without provider reset, and provider-specific update endpoints.
- Follow-up actions: expose optional model catalogs per agent for richer dropdown UX and validate model ids against runtime-reported config options when available.

## ADR-027: ACP-backed Agent Model Catalog Endpoint and UI Dropdown Wiring

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-03-05
- Context: Web UI hardcoded model lists drift from runtime reality; users need model options sourced directly from each agent's ACP runtime so create/switch flows stay accurate across codex/claude/opencode/gemini/kimi/qwen.
- Decision:
  - add `GET /v1/agents/{agentId}/models` and wire it to a backend `AgentModelsFactory`.
  - implement per-agent ACP discovery handshake (`initialize` + `session/new`) and parse model options from:
    - `session/new.configOptions` (`id=model`) for embedded codex/claude (acp-adapter latest).
    - `session/new.models.availableModels` for opencode/gemini/kimi/qwen.
  - normalize response shape to `[{id,name}]`, de-duplicate by `id`, and return `503 UPSTREAM_UNAVAILABLE` on discovery failure.
  - replace active-thread free-text model control with dropdown powered by the new endpoint:
    - active-thread header switches via dropdown + `PATCH /v1/threads/{threadId}`.
  - keep new-thread modal focused on agent/cwd/title creation and advanced JSON (no dedicated model selector).
- Consequences: model selection UX is runtime-accurate and provider-specific without frontend hardcoding; failure mode is explicit (upstream unavailable) and localized to model discovery.
- Alternatives considered: keep hardcoded frontend catalogs, or validate only at prompt-time without exposing a catalog endpoint.
- Follow-up actions: optionally add short-lived server-side model catalog cache and server-side create/update validation against discovered options.

```

## ADR-001: HTTP/JSON API with SSE Streaming

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-02-28
- Context: turn output is incremental and long-running; clients need low-latency updates.
- Decision: use HTTP/JSON for request-response operations and SSE for server-to-client event streaming.
- Consequences: simpler client/network compatibility than WebSocket for one-way stream; requires reconnect/resume handling.
- Alternatives considered: WebSocket-only transport, polling.
- Follow-up actions: define event replay semantics and heartbeat policy.

## ADR-002: Client Identity via `X-Client-ID`

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-02-28
- Context: server must isolate resources across multiple clients.
- Decision: require `X-Client-ID` on authenticated endpoints and scope data by that identity.
- Consequences: easy stateless routing and testing; header contract must be documented and validated strictly.
- Alternatives considered: query parameter id, session cookie.
- Follow-up actions: add optional auth token binding for production mode.

## ADR-003: SQLite Events as Source of Truth

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-02-28
- Context: stream continuity and restart recovery require durable event history.
- Decision: persist turn events in append-only `events` table, indexed by thread/turn and sequence.
- Consequences: enables replay and audits; requires careful handling of SQLite contention.
- Alternatives considered: in-memory stream only, external queue.
- Follow-up actions: implement WAL mode, busy timeout, and compaction policy.

## ADR-004: Permission Workflow Fail-Closed

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-02-28
- Context: runtime permissions are security-sensitive.
- Decision: when client decision is missing/invalid/late, default to deny.
- Consequences: safer default posture; may interrupt slow clients.
- Alternatives considered: fail-open with audit warning.
- Follow-up actions: add configurable timeout and clear UX hints.

## ADR-005: Localhost-by-Default Network Policy

- Status: Superseded by ADR-021
- Date: 2026-02-28
- Context: server may expose local filesystem and command capabilities.
- Decision: default bind `127.0.0.1:8686`; require explicit `--allow-public=true` for public interfaces.
- Consequences: secure local default; remote access requires intentional operator action.
- Alternatives considered: public by default.
- Follow-up actions: add warning log when public bind is enabled.

## ADR-021: Public-by-Default Bind with Local-Only Opt-Out

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-03-01
- Context: the primary use case is multi-device access (phone/tablet) on the same LAN, using the startup QR code for quick connection.
- Decision:
  - default bind changes to `0.0.0.0:8686`.
  - `--allow-public` defaults to `true`; setting `--allow-public=false` restricts binds to loopback only.
  - startup output prints a QR code for device-reachable access and prints the service port under the QR code.
- Consequences:
  - easier out-of-the-box access from other devices.
  - operators must opt out explicitly when they need loopback-only safety.
- Alternatives considered:
  - keep localhost default and require an explicit `--allow-public=true`.
  - add separate `--public`/`--local-only` flags.

## ADR-006: M1 API Baseline for Health/Auth/Agents

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-02-28
- Context: M1 requires a minimal but stable API contract before thread/turn APIs are implemented.
- Decision:
  - define `GET /healthz` response as `{ "ok": true }`.
  - define `GET /v1/agents` response key as `agents` with `id/name/status` fields.
  - gate only `/v1/*` endpoints behind optional bearer token (`--auth-token`).
  - standardize error envelope as `{ "error": { "code", "message", "details" } }`.
- Consequences: contract is simpler for clients and tests; request-id/hint fields are deferred to later milestones.
- Alternatives considered: keep earlier draft response schemas with extra fields.
- Follow-up actions: extend same error envelope to all future endpoints and document additional error codes as APIs expand.

## ADR-007: M3 Thread API Tenancy and Path Policy

- Status: Superseded by ADR-016
- Date: 2026-02-28
- Context: thread APIs introduce per-client resource ownership and filesystem-scoped execution context.
- Decision:
  - require `X-Client-ID` on all `/v1/*` endpoints and upsert client heartbeat on each request.
  - enforce `cwd` as absolute path under configured allowed roots.
  - return `404` for cross-client thread access to avoid existence leakage.
  - thread creation only persists metadata and does not start any agent process.
- Consequences: stronger tenancy boundaries and safer path policy at API edge; clients must always include identity header.
- Alternatives considered: permissive cross-client errors (`403`) and late validation in turn execution stage.
- Follow-up actions: wire same tenancy/path checks through turns and permission endpoints in M4+.

## ADR-008: M4 Turn Streaming over SSE with Persisted Event Log

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-02-28
- Context: turns must stream incremental output while preserving durable history, cancellation, and per-thread single-active constraints.
- Decision:
  - use `POST /v1/threads/{threadId}/turns` as SSE response endpoint.
  - persist each emitted SSE event (`turn_started`, `message_delta`, `turn_completed`, `error`) into `events` table.
  - enforce one active turn per thread with in-memory controller; concurrent start on same thread returns `409 CONFLICT`.
  - implement `POST /v1/turns/{turnId}/cancel` to cancel active turn promptly.
  - expose `GET /v1/threads/{threadId}/history` with optional `includeEvents` query.
- Consequences: simple, testable streaming pipeline before provider integration; active-turn state is process-local and will require restart-recovery work in later milestones.
- Alternatives considered: separate stream endpoint per turn, websocket transport for M4.
- Follow-up actions: add restart-safe active-turn recovery and provider-backed execution in M5+.

## ADR-009: M5 ACP Stdio Provider and Permission Bridge

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-02-28
- Context: M5 requires talking to ACP agents over stdio JSON-RPC and forwarding permission requests to HTTP clients with fail-closed semantics.
- Decision:
  - add `internal/agents/acp` provider that launches one external ACP agent process per streamed turn and handles newline-delimited JSON-RPC on stdio.
  - support inbound ACP message classes: response (pending id match), notification (`session/update`), request (`session/request_permission`; unknown methods return JSON-RPC method-not-found).
  - add `POST /v1/permissions/{permissionId}` and SSE event `permission_required`; bridge decisions back to ACP request responses.
  - timeout/disconnect default to `declined` (fail-closed); fake ACP flow converges with `stopReason="cancelled"`.
  - persist turn/event writes with `context.WithoutCancel(r.Context())` so terminal state is still durable after stream disconnect.
- Consequences: permission path is secure by default and testable without real codex dependency; pending permission lifecycle is process-local and late decisions can race with auto-close.
- Alternatives considered: fail-open timeout policy, websocket permission callbacks, delaying persistence until stream close.
- Follow-up actions: expose permission timeout metadata and add explicit permission-resolution terminal events.

## ADR-010: M6 Codex-ACP-Go Runtime Wiring

- Status: Superseded by ADR-014
- Date: 2026-02-28
- Context: M6 needs real codex provider enablement while keeping default tests stable in environments without codex binaries.
- Decision:
  - add runtime flags `--codex-acp-go-bin` and `--codex-acp-go-args` for codex ACP process configuration.
  - `GET /v1/agents` reports codex status as `unconfigured` when binary is absent and `available` when configured.
  - resolve turn provider lazily via a per-turn factory; codex turns create `internal/agents/acp` clients on demand.
  - use persisted `thread.cwd` as ACP process working directory for each turn.
  - keep default automated tests codex-independent; add env-gated optional smoke test (`E2E_CODEX=1` + `CODEX_ACP_GO_BIN`).
- Consequences: production path can run real codex providers without starting background processes at server boot; optional integration remains explicit and non-blocking for CI.
- Alternatives considered: eager provider startup on server boot, replacing existing tests with codex-only integration.
- Follow-up actions: add richer codex health diagnostics and startup validation in M8.

## ADR-011: M7 Context Window Injection and Compact Policy

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-02-28
- Context: turns must preserve continuity across long threads and server restarts without relying on provider in-memory session state.
- Decision:
  - build per-turn injected prompt from `threads.summary` + recent non-internal turns + current input.
  - add runtime controls `context-recent-turns`, `context-max-chars`, and `compact-max-chars`.
  - enforce deterministic trimming order: drop oldest recent turns, then shrink summary, then shrink current input only as last resort.
  - add manual compact endpoint `POST /v1/threads/{threadId}/compact` that runs an internal summarization turn and persists updated `threads.summary`.
  - add `turns.is_internal` to mark compact/system turns and hide them from default history (`includeInternal=true` opt-in).
  - rebuild context solely from durable SQLite data after restart.
- Consequences: predictable context budget behavior and restart-safe continuity with auditable compact turns.
- Alternatives considered: provider-only session memory, in-memory context cache without durable summary, token-based approximate truncation only.
- Follow-up actions: add automatic compact trigger heuristics and token-aware budgeting in M8.

## ADR-012: M8 Reliability Alignment (TTL, Shutdown, Error Codes)

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-02-28
- Context: final milestone requires explicit guarantees for concurrency conflicts, idle resource cleanup, shutdown behavior, and consistent API error semantics.
- Decision:
  - keep one-active-turn-per-thread invariant with `409 CONFLICT` and add additional concurrent multi-thread coverage.
  - add thread-agent cache with idle janitor (`agent-idle-ttl`) and JSON logs for idle reclaim/close actions.
  - add graceful shutdown flow: stop accepting requests, wait active turns, then force-cancel on timeout with structured logs.
  - unify API/SSE error code set to: `INVALID_ARGUMENT`, `UNAUTHORIZED`, `FORBIDDEN`, `NOT_FOUND`, `CONFLICT`, `TIMEOUT`, `INTERNAL`, `UPSTREAM_UNAVAILABLE`.
  - keep SSE disconnect fail-fast/fail-closed behavior to avoid hanging turns.
  - align acceptance checklist to executable `go test` plus `curl` verification commands.
- Consequences: operational behavior is predictable under contention, disconnects, and process lifecycle transitions.
- Alternatives considered: no idle janitor (manual cleanup only), immediate hard shutdown without grace period, preserving non-unified legacy error codes.
- Follow-up actions: optional enhancements after M8 include WebSocket transport, paginated history, RBAC, and audit expansion.

## ADR-013: Canonical Go Module Path Finalization

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-02-28
- Context: repository ownership and canonical GitHub path are now stable (`github.com/beyond5959/ngent`), while source imports still used a placeholder module path.
- Decision:
  - set `go.mod` module path to `github.com/beyond5959/ngent`.
  - update all in-repo imports from `github.com/example/code-agent-hub-server/...` to canonical module path.
- Consequences: local builds/tests and downstream module consumers resolve a single stable import path; placeholder path drift is removed.
- Alternatives considered: keep placeholder path longer and defer until post-release.
- Follow-up actions: ensure any external examples/scripts use canonical import path only.

## ADR-014: Codex Provider Migration to Embedded Library

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-02-28
- Context: sidecar mode required user-facing binary path configuration (`--codex-acp-go-bin`) and made deployment ergonomics/error modes depend on path wiring.
- Decision:
  - replace codex turn execution from external `codex-acp-go` process spawning to in-process `github.com/beyond5959/acp-adapter/pkg/codexacp` embedded runtime.
  - remove user-facing codex binary path flags; server now links acp-adapter library directly.
  - keep lazy startup and per-thread isolation by creating one embedded runtime per thread provider on first turn.
  - keep existing HTTP/SSE/permission/history contracts unchanged; permission round-trip remains fail-closed.
  - set `/v1/agents` codex status by embedded runtime preflight (`available`/`unavailable`) instead of path-config presence.
- Consequences: simpler operator UX and fewer path misconfiguration failures; server binary is now more tightly coupled to acp-adapter module/runtime behavior.
- Alternatives considered: keep sidecar-only mode; dual mode (embedded + sidecar fallback).
- Follow-up actions: define acp-adapter version pin/upgrade policy and add compatibility smoke checks across codex CLI/app-server versions.

## ADR-015: First-Turn Prompt Passthrough for Embedded Slash Commands

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-02-28
- Context: context-window injection always wrapped prompts with `[Conversation Summary]` / `[Recent Turns]` / `[Current User Input]`, which masked first-turn slash commands (for example `/mcp call`) in embedded acp-adapter flows.
- Decision:
  - keep context wrapper for normal multi-turn continuity.
  - when `summary == ""` and there are no visible recent turns, pass through raw `currentInput` (still bounded by `context-max-chars`) instead of wrapping.
- Consequences:
  - first-turn slash commands remain functional in embedded mode, enabling deterministic permission round-trip validation (`approved` / `declined`).
  - first-turn request text persisted in history no longer includes synthetic wrapper headings.
- Alternatives considered:
  - parse wrapped `[Current User Input]` inside acp-adapter slash-command parser.
  - keep always-wrapped behavior and accept slash-command incompatibility.
- Follow-up actions:
  - evaluate an explicit API-level raw-input toggle if future providers need slash-command compatibility beyond first turn.

## ADR-016: Remove `--allowed-root` Runtime Parameter

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-02-28
- Context: operators requested simpler startup without path allowlist configuration and required that `cwd` can be any user-specified absolute directory.
- Decision:
  - remove CLI flag `--allowed-root`.
  - server startup now configures allowed-roots internally as filesystem root.
  - keep `cwd` validation for absolute path only and retain tenancy/ownership rules.
- Consequences:
  - simpler startup and fewer configuration errors.
  - path-boundary restriction is effectively disabled in default runtime behavior.
- Alternatives considered:
  - keep `--allowed-root` and add a separate opt-out flag.
  - preserve strict allowlist-only behavior.
- Follow-up actions:
  - evaluate policy controls (for example opt-in restrictive mode) if deployments need stronger path boundaries.

## ADR-017: Human-Readable Startup Summary and Request Access Logs

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-02-28
- Context: local operators found single-line JSON startup output hard to scan quickly; runtime troubleshooting also needed stable request completion telemetry.
- Decision:
  - print a concise multi-line startup summary to stderr with a QR code; print the service port and a concrete URL under the QR code.
  - keep structured request completion logs via `slog` for all HTTP traffic.
  - include `req_time`, `method`, `path`, `ip`, `status`, `duration_ms`, and `resp_bytes` in completion logs.
  - standardize log `time` and request `req_time` to UTC `time.DateTime` second precision for easier human scanning and stable parsing.
- Consequences:
  - local startup UX is easier to read without parsing JSON.
  - request observability is consistent across normal JSON responses and long-lived SSE requests.
- Alternatives considered:
  - keep startup as JSON only.
  - add ad-hoc per-endpoint logging instead of one centralized completion logger.
- Follow-up actions:
  - add optional request id correlation in completion logs and outbound SSE error events.

## ADR-019: OpenCode ACP stdio provider

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-03-01
- Context: OpenCode supports ACP and is an actively developed coding agent; adding it as a provider gives users an alternative to the embedded Codex runtime.
- Decision: implement `internal/agents/opencode` as a standalone ACP stdio provider. One `opencode acp --cwd <dir>` process is spawned per turn. The package is self-contained with its own JSON-RPC 2.0 transport layer to avoid coupling with the internal `acp` package.
- Protocol differences from codex ACP that drove a separate implementation:
  - `protocolVersion` field is an integer (`1`) not a string.
  - `session/new` does not accept a client-supplied sessionId; the server assigns one and also returns a model list.
  - `session/prompt` uses a `prompt` array of content items instead of a flat `input` string.
  - `session/update` notifications carry delta text under `update.content.text` for `agent_message_chunk` events, not a flat `delta` field.
  - No `session/request_permission` requests from server to client (OpenCode handles tool permissions internally via MCP).
- Consequences:
  - `opencode` binary must be in PATH for the provider to be available; Preflight() is called at startup.
  - Model selection is optional via `agentOptions.modelId` in thread creation; defaults to OpenCode's configured default.
  - Turn cancel sends `session/cancel` and kills the process within 2s if it doesn't exit cleanly.

## ADR-020: Gemini CLI ACP stdio provider

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-03-01
- Context: Gemini CLI (v0.31+) supports ACP via `--experimental-acp` flag; it uses the `@agentclientprotocol/sdk` npm package which speaks standard newline-delimited JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio.
- Decision: implement `internal/agents/gemini` as a standalone ACP stdio provider. One `gemini --experimental-acp` process is spawned per turn. Protocol flow: `initialize` → `authenticate` → `session/new` → `session/prompt` with streaming `session/update` notifications.
- Key protocol details:
  - `PROTOCOL_VERSION = 1` (integer).
  - An explicit `authenticate({methodId: "gemini-api-key"})` call is required between `initialize` and `session/new` so Gemini reads `GEMINI_API_KEY` from the environment.
  - `GEMINI_CLI_HOME` is set to a fresh temp directory per turn, containing a minimal `settings.json` that selects API key auth; this prevents Gemini CLI from writing OAuth browser prompts to stdout, which would corrupt the JSON-RPC stream.
  - `session/update` notifications carry delta text under `update.content.text` for `agent_message_chunk` events (same structure as OpenCode).
  - Gemini can send `session/request_permission` requests; the provider bridges these through the hub server's `PermissionHandler` context mechanism. Approved maps to `{outcome: {outcome: "selected", optionId: "allow_once"}}`, declined to `reject_once`, cancelled to `{outcome: {outcome: "cancelled"}}`.
  - Turn cancel sends a `session/cancel` notification (no id, no response expected) and kills the process within 2s.
- Consequences:
  - `gemini` binary must be in PATH and `GEMINI_API_KEY` must be set for the provider to be available.
  - No model selection option at thread creation time; model is controlled by Gemini CLI's own configuration.

## ADR-022: Qwen Code ACP stdio provider integration

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-03-03
- Context:
  - Qwen Code is available locally and supports ACP via `qwen --acp`.
  - hub requirements remain strict: one-active-turn-per-thread, fast cancel, fail-closed permissions, and no regressions for existing providers.
  - protocol inspection shows required ACP fields (`clientCapabilities.fs`, `mcpServers`) and provider-specific response variants.
- Decision:
  - implemented `internal/agents/qwen` as a standalone ACP stdio provider (one process per turn).
  - process command is fixed as `qwen --acp` (no user-supplied binary path in server config).
  - protocol flow is `initialize -> session/new -> session/prompt`, with required params:
    - `initialize.protocolVersion = 1`
    - `initialize.clientCapabilities.fs.readTextFile = false`
    - `initialize.clientCapabilities.fs.writeTextFile = false`
    - `session/new` includes `cwd` and `mcpServers: []`
    - `session/prompt` uses ACP prompt blocks (`[{type:"text", text:...}]`)
  - stream output is parsed from `session/update` when `update.sessionUpdate == "agent_message_chunk"` and delta comes from `update.content.text`.
  - handle `session/request_permission` by mapping hub decisions into ACP outcome format:
    - approve/decline: `outcome=selected` with matching `optionId`
    - cancel: `outcome=cancelled`
    - default deny on timeout/errors/no handler (fail-closed)
  - cancellation path sends `session/cancel` with `sessionId` on context cancellation and converges to `stopReason=cancelled`.
  - stderr is drained/discarded to avoid protocol stream corruption; existing providers (`codex`, `opencode`, `gemini`) behavior remains unchanged.
- Consequences:
  - qwen availability is startup-preflight dependent (`qwen` in PATH).
  - real qwen turns depend on local runtime prerequisites (writable qwen home/config + auth/network readiness), so environment misconfiguration can fail before ACP turn execution.
  - provider must tolerate schema drift across qwen versions (new optional fields in `session/new` response).
  - test surface expanded:
    - fake-process ACP tests for initialize/session/new/session/prompt/session/update
    - permission mapping tests (`approved`, `declined`, `cancelled`)
    - optional real smoke test (`E2E_QWEN=1`)
- Alternatives considered:
  - reuse a single generic ACP provider configured by command/args at runtime.
  - force qwen through existing `opencode`/`gemini` adapters.
  - postpone qwen until ACP schema is frozen upstream.
- Follow-up actions:
  - improve qwen preflight diagnostics for filesystem/auth prerequisites (beyond PATH existence).
  - keep validating against newer qwen releases for ACP schema compatibility.

## ADR-023: Shared ACP stdio transport for OpenCode and Qwen providers

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-03-03
- Context:
  - `internal/agents/opencode` and `internal/agents/qwen` had duplicated JSON-RPC stdio transport code (request id/pending map, read loop, inbound request handling, notify/call framing, process termination helpers).
  - duplicated protocol plumbing increased maintenance risk and made bug fixes easy to diverge across providers.
- Decision:
  - extracted shared package `internal/agents/acpstdio` with:
    - newline-delimited JSON-RPC connection (`Conn`) supporting `Call`, `Notify`, notifications, and inbound request handling.
    - shared JSON-RPC message/error types.
    - shared helpers: `ParseSessionID`, `ParseStopReason`, `TerminateProcess`.
  - refactored both providers to use the shared transport while keeping provider-specific ACP behavior unchanged:
    - OpenCode flow and modelId handling unchanged.
    - Qwen permission mapping and fail-closed behavior unchanged.
- Consequences:
  - transport-layer fixes are now centralized and consistent across providers.
  - provider files are shorter and focused on protocol semantics instead of wire plumbing.
  - regression risk from this refactor is controlled by fake-process tests + full `go test ./...` + real E2E smoke tests for both providers.
- Alternatives considered:
  - keep duplicated transport code and only copy fixes manually.
  - extract only tiny helper funcs without shared connection type.
- Follow-up actions:
  - if Gemini migration value is clear, evaluate moving Gemini transport to `acpstdio` in a separate change (to keep current refactor blast radius limited).

## ADR-024: Claude Code embedded provider via claudeacp runtime

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-03-03
- Context:
  - Claude Code is the primary Anthropic coding agent; it was listed as a planned provider (`🔜`) since project inception.
  - `github.com/beyond5959/acp-adapter` already contained a complete parallel `pkg/claudeacp` package with identical API surface to `pkg/codexacp`; no new library dependency was needed.
  - Preflight for Claude does not require a binary path check — availability is determined entirely by the presence of `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` in the environment.
- Decision:
  - implement `internal/agents/claude` as an embedded provider package mirroring `internal/agents/codex`.
  - replace `codexacp` references with `claudeacp`; `Preflight()` checks `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN != ""` (no binary lookup).
  - `DefaultRuntimeConfig()` delegates to `claudeacp.DefaultRuntimeConfig()`, which reads `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` and `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` from environment.
  - wire into server startup: preflight, `/v1/agents` status, `AllowedAgentIDs`, and `TurnAgentFactory`.
  - for local development, add `replace github.com/beyond5959/acp-adapter => /path/to/local/acp-adapter` in `go.mod`; remove or publish before production release.
- Consequences:
  - claude availability is purely environment-variable dependent; no binary installation required beyond valid API credentials.
  - `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` allows pointing at a compatible proxy or local endpoint (e.g., for testing or corporate gateways).
  - local `go.mod` replace directive must be removed or updated to a published version before CI/release builds.
- Alternatives considered:
  - implement as an ACP stdio provider wrapping the `claude` CLI binary (rejected: CLI spawns its own runtime per invocation with higher latency and no direct permission bridge).
  - share implementation with codex via generics/interface (rejected: would couple two independently-versioned runtimes).
- Follow-up actions:
  - publish `acp-adapter` with `pkg/claudeacp` to a versioned tag and remove the `replace` directive from `go.mod`.
  - add permission round-trip E2E test for Claude (approved/declined/cancelled paths).

## ADR-025: Thread-level model switching via ACP session config options

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-03-05
- Context:
  - model switching previously used thread metadata patch (`PATCH /v1/threads/{threadId}` with `agentOptions.modelId`) and recreated provider state, while ACP now standardizes runtime config through `session/new.configOptions` + `session/set_config_option`.
  - Web UI requirement is immediate switch on model select (no extra apply action), and model list/selected value must come from ACP session config data (including per-model descriptions).
- Decision:
  - add thread-scoped config option endpoints:
    - `GET /v1/threads/{threadId}/config-options`
    - `POST /v1/threads/{threadId}/config-options` (`configId`, `value`)
  - `POST` applies changes through provider `SetConfigOption`, backed by ACP `session/set_config_option`.
  - support `ConfigOptionManager` on all built-in providers:
    - embedded (`codex`, `claude`): mutate cached session in-place.
    - stdio (`opencode`, `qwen`, `gemini`, `kimi`): perform ACP handshake/apply flow and persist resulting model id for subsequent turns.
  - keep `agentOptions.modelId` as durable thread metadata mirror when `configId=model` succeeds.
  - Web UI model selector is bound to thread-level `configOptions` model option and applies immediately on `change`.
- Consequences:
  - model UX is consistent with ACP protocol semantics and no longer depends on separate apply state.
  - per-option descriptions are available to UI and rendered beneath selector.
  - active-turn safety remains strict (`409` on config mutation while turn is active).
- Alternatives considered:
  - continue using thread patch only and skip ACP `session/set_config_option`.
  - expose only agent-level model catalog and infer current model from local metadata.
- Follow-up actions:
  - optionally add richer Web UI rendering for non-model config categories (e.g. reasoning level) using the same API.

## ADR-026: Persist agent config catalogs in SQLite and refresh them asynchronously on startup

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-03-06
- Context:
  - thread config UX now depends on ACP `configOptions`, especially model-specific reasoning choices.
  - querying live providers on every thread switch is unnecessary and becomes user-visible after server restart because model/reasoning catalogs are metadata, not per-turn output.
  - different threads on the same agent can keep different selected model/reasoning values, while still reusing the same underlying catalog data.
- Decision:
  - add sqlite table `agent_config_catalogs(agent_id, model_id, config_options_json, updated_at)` and persist normalized ACP config-options snapshots there.
  - keep per-thread selected values in `threads.agent_options_json`:
    - `modelId`
    - `configOverrides`
  - read path:
    - `GET /v1/threads/{threadId}/config-options` first loads the stored catalog row for the thread's selected model (or a reserved default snapshot when no model is selected yet), then overlays the thread's own selected current values.
    - `GET /v1/agents/{agentId}/models` derives model list from stored catalogs before falling back to live discovery.
  - write path:
    - `POST /v1/threads/{threadId}/config-options` still mutates the live provider/session, then persists both thread selection state and the current model's returned config-options snapshot.
  - startup behavior:
    - launch a background refresher goroutine after server initialization.
    - refresher queries default + per-model config catalogs for built-in agents and updates sqlite without delaying HTTP startup or blocking frontend requests.
    - on partial refresh failure, keep previously stored rows for models that could not be refreshed instead of deleting them.
- Consequences:
  - restart no longer forces frontend-visible catalog discovery in the common case; stored model/reasoning metadata remains immediately available.
  - reasoning lists remain model-specific while thread-selected current values stay isolated per thread.
  - partial refresh strategy trades perfect freshness for availability and catalog continuity.
- Alternatives considered:
  - keep catalogs only in frontend memory and re-query on restart.
  - store only an agent-level flat reasoning list (rejected because reasoning is model-dependent).
  - block startup until all agents refresh live catalogs (rejected because it would directly impact frontend responsiveness).

## ADR-029: Consolidate sidebar thread actions into a drawer and reuse thread patch for rename

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-03-06
- Context:
  - sidebar thread rows already show dense metadata and activity state; a direct delete affordance makes the list visually noisy and increases the chance of accidental destructive clicks.
  - thread rename is metadata-only and should share the existing thread ownership/conflict semantics instead of adding a dedicated endpoint.
- Decision:
  - replace the direct sidebar delete button with a per-thread drawer trigger.
  - render drawer actions as text-only controls in this order:
    - `Rename`
    - `Delete` (danger styling)
  - extend `PATCH /v1/threads/{threadId}` to accept optional `title` in addition to `agentOptions`.
  - keep rename under the same active-turn conflict guard as other thread mutations.
- Consequences:
  - sidebar actions are less visually noisy and destructive actions are one click deeper.
  - rename and thread metadata/config mutations now share one API contract.
  - users must wait for a running turn to finish, or cancel it, before renaming the thread.

## ADR-030: Handle codex `item/tool/requestUserInput` and `item/tool/call` without hard RPC failure

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-03-06
- Context:
  - codex app-server may emit server requests `item/tool/requestUserInput` and `item/tool/call` during MCP-related operations.
  - previous bridge behavior returned `-32000 ... is not supported`, which caused app-server-side hard errors and interrupted command flow.
- Decision:
  - implement a compatibility fallback in embedded adapter path:
    - for `item/tool/requestUserInput`: return schema-compatible `answers` payload by auto-selecting the first option label for each question.
    - for `item/tool/call`: return schema-compatible `DynamicToolCallResponse` with `success=false` and one text content item, instead of throwing RPC method error.
- Consequences:
  - removes immediate `-32000` hard-fail class for these methods and allows app-server to continue handling tool flow.
  - behavior is still a fallback (not full interactive user-input / dynamic-tool execution support).
- Alternatives considered:
  - keep fail-closed `-32000` hard error (rejected: user-facing breakage for MCP flows).
  - fully implement interactive user-input/dynamic tool execution end-to-end in hub UI + protocol bridge in one step (rejected for hotfix scope).

## ADR-031: Kimi CLI ACP stdio provider with dual startup syntax fallback

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-03-09
- Context:
  - Kimi CLI now exposes ACP mode in upstream docs, but current official pages show both `kimi acp` and `kimi --acp` as startup forms.
  - hub requirements remain unchanged: one active turn per thread, fast cancel, fail-closed permissions, and no user-supplied binary-path flags.
- Decision:
  - implement `internal/agents/kimi` as a standalone ACP stdio provider (one process per turn).
  - startup tries `kimi acp` first, then retries with `kimi --acp` if the first form fails before ACP initialize completes.
  - keep protocol flow aligned with existing stdio providers:
    - `initialize -> session/new -> session/prompt`
    - stream deltas from `session/update` / `agent_message_chunk`
    - handle `session/request_permission` with fail-closed mapping
    - send `session/cancel` on context cancellation
  - wire `kimi` into startup preflight, `/v1/agents`, thread allowlist, turn factory, model discovery, and startup catalog refresh.
- Consequences:
  - Kimi becomes a built-in provider without adding new runtime flags or config surface.
  - startup is resilient to the current upstream command-form drift across Kimi CLI docs/releases.
  - real Kimi turns still depend on local Kimi authentication and network readiness.
- Alternatives considered:
  - hardcode only `kimi acp` (rejected: conflicts with current upstream `--acp` docs).
  - hardcode only `kimi --acp` (rejected: conflicts with IDE integration docs and user expectation).
  - add a user-facing command override flag (rejected: unnecessary config surface and contrary to current built-in provider policy).

## ADR-032: Shared common agent config/state helper without protocol unification

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-03-09
- Context:
  - built-in agents duplicated the same common fields and methods repeatedly:
    - `Dir`
    - `ModelID`
    - `ConfigOverrides`
    - model/config override normalization, cloning, and state updates after `SetConfigOption`
  - the duplicated code existed across both stdio providers (`gemini`, `opencode`, `qwen`, `kimi`) and embedded providers (`codex`, `claude`).
  - previous experience in this repo shows that protocol flows diverge materially between providers, so a single generic provider abstraction would be riskier than the duplication it removes.
- Decision:
  - extract shared common config/state into `internal/agents/agentutil`:
    - `agentutil.Config`
    - `agentutil.State`
  - move only common constructor validation and mutable model/config-override state management into the shared helper.
  - keep each provider's transport/runtime/session logic independent.
- Consequences:
  - repeated per-provider bookkeeping is reduced without coupling unrelated ACP/runtime flows.
  - future providers can reuse the same common state helper while still implementing provider-specific protocol behavior.
  - embedded and stdio providers remain free to evolve independently where their protocol/runtime requirements differ.
- Alternatives considered:
  - create one generic ACP provider with pluggable commands and hooks (rejected: protocol differences are too large and already visible across current providers).
  - leave duplicated `Config`/`Client` state in place (rejected: ongoing maintenance cost and drift risk).

## ADR-033: Surface ACP plan updates as first-class SSE and Web UI state

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-03-09
- Context:
  - ACP agents can emit `session/update` notifications with `sessionUpdate == "plan"` and a full `entries[]` list describing the current execution plan.
  - the hub previously only mapped `agent_message_chunk` into `message_delta`, so users could not see plan progress in the Web UI and history reloads lost that context entirely.
- Decision:
  - normalize ACP `session/update` payloads in shared agent code, recognizing both `agent_message_chunk` and `plan`.
  - route plan replacements through a new per-turn `PlanHandler` context callback, parallel to the existing permission callback pattern.
  - emit and persist a dedicated SSE/history event `plan_update` with payload `{"turnId","entries":[]}`.
  - render `plan_update` in the Web UI as a live plan card above the streaming agent bubble, and rebuild the final plan state from persisted turn events when loading history.
- Consequences:
  - ACP plan state is now visible during live execution without overloading `message_delta`.
  - history replay preserves the last known plan instead of dropping it on refresh.
  - empty `entries[]` remains meaningful as "clear the current plan", so the hub must preserve replacement semantics instead of merging incrementally.
- Alternatives considered:
  - fold plan text into `message_delta` (rejected: mixes distinct ACP concepts and loses replacement semantics).
  - keep plan rendering purely transient in the browser (rejected: history reload would still discard plan state).

## ADR-034: Source Kimi config catalogs from local config to avoid empty sessions

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-03-09
- Context:
  - Kimi CLI persists ACP `session/new` handshakes as local session history, even when the hub only wants model/config metadata and never sends a prompt.
  - the previous Kimi provider queried models and thread config options through `session/new`, which polluted `~/.kimi/sessions` with empty sessions during startup catalog refresh, thread config loads, and model changes.
  - local Kimi config already exposes the needed metadata: `default_model`, `default_thinking`, and model capabilities.
- Decision:
  - read Kimi model catalog and default thinking state from local `config.toml` when available.
  - synthesize thread `ConfigOptions` and `DiscoverModels()` results from that local config instead of ACP `session/new`.
  - apply reasoning overrides for real prompt turns through Kimi startup flags (`--thinking` / `--no-thinking`) and keep model selection on `--model`.
  - retain ACP fallback only when local config cannot be read or parsed.
- Consequences:
  - Kimi thread config queries and startup catalog refresh no longer create empty session history entries in normal local setups.
  - Kimi keeps real ACP turns for actual prompts, permissions, streaming, and cancellation behavior.
  - local config structure becomes part of the provider compatibility surface, so future Kimi config schema drift must be monitored.
- Alternatives considered:
  - keep ACP-only config discovery (rejected: side effect creates noisy empty sessions).
  - disable Kimi config/model catalog refresh entirely (rejected: would regress model picker accuracy).
