# ACCEPTANCE

This checklist defines executable acceptance checks for requirements 1-16.

## Requirement 1: HTTP/JSON plus SSE

- Operation: call JSON endpoint and one SSE turn endpoint.
- Expected: JSON response is `application/json`; turn endpoint is `text/event-stream`.
- Verification command:
  - `curl -sS -i http://127.0.0.1:8686/healthz`
  - `curl -sS -N -H 'X-Client-ID: demo' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"input":"hello","stream":true}' http://127.0.0.1:8686/v1/threads/<threadId>/turns`
  - `go test ./internal/httpapi -run TestTurnsSSEAndHistory -count=1`

## Requirement 2: Multi-client and multi-thread support

- Operation: create threads under different `X-Client-ID` headers and verify isolation.
- Expected: no cross-client leakage.
- Verification command:
  - `go test ./internal/httpapi -run TestThreadAccessAcrossClientsReturnsNotFound -count=1`

## Requirement 3: Per-thread independent agent instance

- Operation: run turns on multiple threads concurrently.
- Expected: each thread resolves/uses its own thread-level agent path.
- Verification command:
  - `go test ./internal/httpapi -run TestMultiThreadParallelTurns -count=1`

## Requirement 4: One active turn per thread plus cancel

- Operation: start first turn, submit second turn on same thread, then cancel.
- Expected: second turn gets `409 CONFLICT`; cancel converges quickly.
- Verification command:
  - `go test ./internal/httpapi -run TestTurnConflictSingleActiveTurnPerThread -count=1`
  - `go test ./internal/httpapi -run TestTurnCancel -count=1`

## Requirement 5: Lazy startup

- Operation: create thread first, then start first turn.
- Expected: provider factory is not called at thread creation; called at first turn only.
- Verification command:
  - `go test ./internal/httpapi -run TestTurnAgentFactoryIsLazy -count=1`

## Requirement 6: Durable SQLite history and restart continuity

- Operation: run turn, recreate server instance with same DB, run next turn.
- Expected: next turn still injects prior history/summary and continues.
- Verification command:
  - `go test ./internal/httpapi -run TestRestartRecoveryWithInjectedContext -count=1`

## Requirement 7: Permission forwarding and fail-closed

- Operation: trigger permission-required flow; test approved, timeout, and disconnect cases.
- Expected: `permission_required` emitted; timeout/disconnect fails closed.
  - embedded codex command-approval flow should not fail with adapter-side `-32601 method not found` when using updated app-server request methods.
- Verification command:
  - `go test ./internal/httpapi -run TestTurnPermissionRequiredSSEEvent -count=1`
  - `go test ./internal/httpapi -run TestTurnPermissionApprovedContinuesAndCompletes -count=1`
  - `go test ./internal/httpapi -run TestTurnPermissionTimeoutFailClosed -count=1`
  - `go test ./internal/httpapi -run TestTurnPermissionSSEDisconnectFailClosed -count=1`

## Requirement 8: Public-by-default bind with local-only opt-out

- Operation: validate listen address policy with/without allow-public.
- Expected: non-loopback bind is allowed by default; `--allow-public=false` restricts to loopback only.
- Verification command:
  - `go test ./cmd/ngent -run TestValidateListenAddr -count=1`

## Requirement 9: Startup logging contract

- Operation: start server and inspect startup output on stderr.
- Expected: startup output is multi-line, human-readable, includes a QR code (when public bind is enabled), and prints the service port + a concrete URL under the QR code.
- Verification command:
  - `go test ./cmd/ngent -count=1`
  - manual run: `go run ./cmd/ngent`

## Requirement 10: Unified errors and structured logs

- Operation: trigger auth failure/path policy failure and inspect request completion logs.
- Expected: `UNAUTHORIZED` and `FORBIDDEN` error envelopes are stable; request logs include `req_time`, `path`, `ip`, and `status`.
- Verification command:
  - `go test ./internal/httpapi -run TestV1AuthToggle -count=1`
  - `go test ./internal/httpapi -run TestCreateThreadValidationCWDAllowedRoots -count=1`
  - `go test ./internal/httpapi -run TestRequestCompletionLogIncludesPathIPAndStatus -count=1`

## Requirement 11: Context window and compact

- Operation: run multiple turns, compact once, verify summary update and injection impact.
- Expected: summary/recent/current-input injection works; compact updates `threads.summary`; internal turns hidden by default.
- Verification command:
  - `go test ./internal/httpapi -run TestInjectedPromptIncludesSummaryAndRecent -count=1`
  - `go test ./internal/httpapi -run TestCompactUpdatesSummaryAndAffectsNextTurn -count=1`

## Requirement 12: Idle TTL reclaim and graceful shutdown

- Operation: configure short idle TTL; verify reclaim; simulate shutdown with active turn.
- Expected: idle thread agent is reclaimed and closed; shutdown force-cancels active turns on timeout.
- Verification command:
  - `go test ./internal/httpapi -run TestAgentIdleTTLReclaimsThreadAgent -count=1`
  - `go test ./cmd/ngent -run TestGracefulShutdownForceCancelsTurns -count=1`

## Requirement 13: Embedded Web UI

- Operation: start server; open browser at `http://127.0.0.1:8686/`.
- Expected: UI loads, threads can be created, turns stream in real time, ACP plan updates render as a live plan card, permissions can be resolved, and history is browsable.
- Verification command:
  - `go test ./internal/webui -count=1` (checks `GET /` returns 200 with `text/html` content-type and SPA fallback)
  - `cd internal/webui/web && npm run build`
  - manual: `make run` → open `http://127.0.0.1:8686/` or scan the startup QR code from another device

## Global Gate

- Operation: run repository checks.
- Expected: formatting and tests are green.
- Verification command:
  - `gofmt -w $(find . -name '*.go' -type f)`
  - `cd internal/webui/web && npm run build`
  - `go test ./...`

## Requirement 14: OpenCode Agent

- Operation: verify opencode provider is listed and can complete a turn.
- Expected: `GET /v1/agents` includes `{"id":"opencode","name":"OpenCode","status":"available"}` when `opencode` is in PATH; a full turn over SSE returns `message_delta` events.
- Verification commands:
  - `go test ./internal/agents/opencode -run TestStreamWithFakeProcess -count=1`
  - `E2E_OPENCODE=1 go test ./internal/agents/opencode -run TestOpenCodeE2ESmoke -v -timeout 60s`

## Requirement 15: Gemini CLI Agent

- Operation: verify Gemini CLI provider is listed and can complete a turn.
- Expected: `GET /v1/agents` includes `{"id":"gemini","name":"Gemini CLI","status":"available"}` when `gemini` is in PATH and `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set; a full turn over SSE returns `message_delta` events.
- Verification commands:
  - `go test ./internal/agents/gemini -run TestStreamWithFakeProcess -count=1`
  - `E2E_GEMINI=1 go test ./internal/agents/gemini -run TestGeminiE2ESmoke -v -timeout 60s`

## Requirement 16: Qwen Code Agent

- Operation: verify qwen provider is listed and can complete a turn over ACP.
- Expected:
  - `GET /v1/agents` includes `{"id":"qwen","name":"Qwen Code","status":"available"}` when `qwen` is in PATH.
  - thread creation accepts `agent=qwen`.
  - turn streaming emits `message_delta` and finishes with `turn_completed` (or explicit upstream error envelope).
  - permission flow remains fail-closed.
- Verification commands (executed 2026-03-03):
  - `qwen --version` (pass, `0.11.0`)
  - `go test ./internal/agents/qwen -count=1` (pass)
  - `E2E_QWEN=1 go test ./internal/agents/qwen -run TestQwenE2ESmoke -v -timeout 120s` (pass, real prompt returns `PONG`)
  - `go test ./cmd/ngent ./internal/httpapi -count=1` (pass)

## Requirement 16A: Kimi CLI Agent

- Operation: verify kimi provider is listed and can complete a turn over ACP.
- Expected:
  - `GET /v1/agents` includes `{"id":"kimi","name":"Kimi CLI","status":"available"}` when `kimi` is in PATH.
  - thread creation accepts `agent=kimi`.
  - turn streaming emits `message_delta` and finishes with `turn_completed` (or explicit upstream error envelope).
  - provider tolerates current upstream ACP startup variants `kimi acp` and `kimi --acp`.
  - thread config/model discovery avoids creating extra empty Kimi sessions when local Kimi config is available.
- Verification commands:
  - `go test ./internal/agents/kimi -count=1`
  - `E2E_KIMI=1 go test ./internal/agents/kimi -run TestKimiConfigOptionsE2EDoesNotCreateSession -v -timeout 120s`
  - `E2E_KIMI=1 go test ./internal/agents/kimi -run TestKimiE2ESmoke -v -timeout 120s`
  - `go test ./cmd/ngent ./internal/httpapi -count=1`

## Requirement 17: Thread Delete Lifecycle

- Operation: delete an existing thread from API/UI, verify ownership behavior, conflict behavior, and provider cleanup.
- Expected:
  - `DELETE /v1/threads/{threadId}` returns `200` with `status=deleted` for same-client thread.
  - deleting a thread with an active turn returns `409 CONFLICT`.
  - deleted thread is no longer visible in list/get/history endpoints.
  - cached thread agent provider is closed when the thread is deleted.
- Verification commands (executed 2026-03-03):
  - `go test ./internal/storage -run TestDeleteThread -count=1`
  - `go test ./internal/httpapi -run TestDeleteThread -count=1`
  - `cd internal/webui/web && npm run build`

## Requirement 18: Thread Model Selection and Switching

- Operation:
  - query agent model catalog via `GET /v1/agents/{agentId}/models`.
  - create thread with `agentOptions.modelId`.
  - update existing thread model via `PATCH /v1/threads/{threadId}`.
  - verify active-turn conflict and provider cache refresh behavior.
- Expected:
  - model catalog endpoint returns ACP-reported provider model options for each built-in agent.
  - thread create/list/get payload includes persisted `agentOptions.modelId`.
  - thread update persists model override and returns updated thread payload.
  - updating while turn is active returns `409 CONFLICT`.
  - successful update closes cached thread provider so next turn uses new model config.
- Verification commands (executed 2026-03-05):
  - `go test ./internal/httpapi -run TestV1AgentModels -count=1`
  - `go test ./internal/agents/acpmodel -count=1`
  - `go test ./internal/storage -run TestUpdateThreadAgentOptions -count=1`
  - `go test ./internal/httpapi -run TestUpdateThreadAgentOptions -count=1`
  - `go test ./internal/httpapi -run TestUpdateThreadConflictWhenActiveTurn -count=1`
  - `go test ./internal/httpapi -run TestUpdateThreadClosesCachedAgent -count=1`
  - `cd internal/webui/web && npm run build`

## Requirement 19: Thread Session Config Options (Model + Reasoning)

- Operation:
  - open/create a thread, query `GET /v1/threads/{threadId}/config-options`.
  - confirm response includes `configOptions` and model/reasoning-style options use ACP `currentValue` + `options`.
  - switch model through `POST /v1/threads/{threadId}/config-options` with `{configId:"model", value:"..."}`.
  - switch a non-model config option (for example reasoning) through the same endpoint.
  - verify persistence of `agentOptions.modelId` and `agentOptions.configOverrides` for subsequent turns/restarts.
  - verify Web UI composer footer shows both `Model` and `Reasoning`, applies on selection (no Apply button), and refreshes reasoning choices after model changes.
- Expected:
  - model selector data source is thread-level ACP `configOptions` (`category=model` / `id=model`).
  - reasoning selector data source is thread-level ACP `configOptions` (`category=reasoning`).
  - selected model changes immediately via ACP `session/set_config_option`.
  - returned and persisted current values stay consistent:
    - `configOptions.model.currentValue` == thread `agentOptions.modelId`
    - non-model current values are mirrored into `thread.agentOptions.configOverrides`
  - normalized model/reasoning catalogs are persisted in sqlite and reused after service restart.
  - startup refresh of persisted catalogs happens asynchronously in the background and does not block frontend/API availability.
  - same-agent threads do not share selected current values, but can reuse the same stored catalog data for the same selected model.
  - active turn mutation is rejected with `409 CONFLICT`.
- Verification commands (executed 2026-03-06):
  - `go test ./internal/httpapi -run TestThreadConfigOptions -count=1`
  - `go test ./internal/httpapi -run TestThreadConfigOptionsPersistConfigOverrides -count=1`
  - `go test ./internal/httpapi -run TestV1AgentModelsUsesStoredCatalog -count=1`
  - `go test ./internal/agents/acpmodel -count=1`
  - `go test ./cmd/ngent -run TestAgentConfigCatalogRefresher -count=1`
  - `go test ./cmd/ngent -run TestExtractConfigOverrides -count=1`
  - `cd internal/webui/web && npm run build`
  - `go test ./...`

## Requirement 20: Thread Drawer Actions and Rename

- Operation:
  - open sidebar thread actions from a thread-row drawer trigger.
  - rename a thread inline from the drawer.
  - delete a thread from the same drawer.
- Expected:
  - thread row exposes a drawer trigger instead of a direct delete icon button.
  - drawer lists `Rename` before `Delete`.
  - delete is text-only and styled as the dangerous action.
  - rename persists `thread.title` through `PATCH /v1/threads/{threadId}` and returns the updated thread payload.
  - rename/delete continue to respect active-turn safety (`409 CONFLICT` while the thread is running).
- Verification commands (executed 2026-03-06):
  - `go test ./internal/storage -run TestUpdateThreadTitle -count=1`
  - `go test ./internal/httpapi -run TestUpdateThreadTitle -count=1`
  - `cd internal/webui/web && npm run build`

## Current Acceptance Result (Integration Update, 2026-03-03)

- Scope: qwen provider implementation + server wiring + test coverage.
- Result:
  - implementation verification passed:
    - qwen provider unit/fake-process tests passed.
    - server/httpapi wiring tests passed (includes qwen allowlist coverage).
  - real qwen smoke in host environment: `Passed`.
  - Requirement 16 status: `Accepted`.

## Requirement 21: Embedded Codex Tool User-Input Request Compatibility

- Operation:
  - trigger codex app-server request path that emits `item/tool/requestUserInput` (for example MCP tool interaction requiring follow-up selection).
  - observe adapter response and downstream behavior.
- Expected:
  - adapter no longer returns JSON-RPC hard error `-32000 ... requestUserInput is not supported`.
  - request receives schema-compatible `answers` payload.
  - `item/tool/call` fallback returns structured response (`success=false`) instead of hard method error.
- Verification commands (executed 2026-03-06):
  - `go test ./...`
  - `cd internal/webui/web && npm run build`
