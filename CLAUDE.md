# CLAUDE.md

This repository implements the **Ngent** — a local-first Go service exposing HTTP/JSON APIs and SSE streaming for multi-client, multi-thread ACP-compatible agent turns.

## Common Commands

```bash
make test          # go test ./...
make fmt           # gofmt -w all .go files
make build-web     # cd web && npm ci && npm run build  (generates web/dist)
make run           # build-web + go run ./cmd/ngent
go build ./...     # compile check
```

## Module Structure

| Package | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `cmd/ngent` | Entry point, CLI flags, startup summary |
| `internal/httpapi` | Routing, request validation, error encoding |
| `internal/runtime` | Thread controller, turn state machine, cancel coordination |
| `internal/agents` | Agent providers: fake, ACP stdio, embedded codex |
| `internal/context` | Prompt injection (summary + recent turns + current input) |
| `internal/sse` | SSE formatting, fanout, resume helpers |
| `internal/storage` | SQLite repository, migration runner |
| `internal/observability` | Structured JSON logging, redaction helpers |

## Mandatory Constraints

- Use **Go 1.24**. Module path: `github.com/beyond5959/ngent`.
- `go test ./...` must pass for every change.
- Input validation:
  - `agent` must be in the server allowlist.
  - `cwd` must be an absolute path.
- Codex provider runs in **embedded mode** (`github.com/beyond5959/acp-adapter/pkg/codexacp`). Do not add user-facing binary path flags.
- Concurrency model:
  - one active turn per `(thread, session)` scope at a time (`409 CONFLICT` on same-scope conflict).
  - cancel must take effect quickly.
  - permission workflow is **fail-closed** by default (timeout/disconnect → `declined`).
- stdout and HTTP response bodies carry **protocol data only**.
- All logs go to **stderr** as JSON via `slog`. Redact sensitive data in logs and errors.
